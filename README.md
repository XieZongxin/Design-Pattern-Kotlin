# Design-Pattern-Kotlin
There are  some design pattern examples written by `kotlin` and adapted from `Java`. I am a beginner of kotlin. Maybe there are some ugly code,even some bugs... But this is my first open source repository, and this is a begin, I will do better next time. Much content refers to a java design pattern blog(http://www.cnblogs.com/maowang1991/archive/2013/04/15/3023236.html)
